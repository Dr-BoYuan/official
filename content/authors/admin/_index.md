Hey, welcome to my personal website.

 I am currently a Lecturer in Computing and academic in Data Science Research Centre, with School of Computing and Engineering, University of Derby, UK.

With my team in the research centre, I explore applied machine learning techniques and business-oriented data science to help companies establish cost-effective IT infrastructures and develop state-of-the-art AI solutions. I am specialising in helping business use analytics to make data-driven decisions and gain competitive advantage.

I am also served as an academic lead who promotes strong collaboration and enhance international influence for research-intensive universities in the UK and Jiangsu Province in China. </p>
