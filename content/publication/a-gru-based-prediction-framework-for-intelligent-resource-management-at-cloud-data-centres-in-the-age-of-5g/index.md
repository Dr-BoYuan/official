abstract: The increasing deployments of 5G mobile communication system is
  expected to bring more processing power and storage supplements to the
  Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. It is foreseeable the billions of
  devices will be connected and it is extremely likely that these devices
  receive compute supplements from Clouds and upload data to the back-end
  datacentres for execution. An increasing number of workloads at the Cloud
  datacentres demand better and efficient strategies of resource management in
  such a way to boost the socio-economic benefits of the service providers. To
  this end, this paper proposes an intelligent prediction framework named
  IGRU-SD (Improved Gated Recurrent Unit with Stragglers Detection) based on
  state-of-art data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, aimed
  at predicting the anticipated level of resource requests over a period of time
  into the future. Our proposed prediction framework exploits an improved GRU
  neural network integrated with a resource straggler detection module to
  classify tasks based on their resource intensity and further predicts the
  expected level of resource requests. Performance evaluations conducted on
  real-world Cloud trace logs demonstrate that the proposed IGRU-SD prediction
  framework outperforms the existing predicting models based on ARIMA, RNN, and
  LSTM in terms of the achieved prediction accuracy.
