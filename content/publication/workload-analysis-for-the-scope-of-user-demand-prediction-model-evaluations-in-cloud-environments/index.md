abstract: Alongside the healthy development of the Cloud-based technologies
  across various application deployments, their associated energy consumptions
  incurred by the excess usage of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
  resources, is one of the serious concerns demanding effective solutions with
  immediate effect. Effective auto-scaling of the Cloud resources in accordance
  to the incoming user demand and thereby reducing the idle resources is one
  optimum solution which not only reduces the excess energy consumptions but
  also helps maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS). Whilst achieving such
  tasks, estimating the user demand in advance with a reliable level of accuracy
  has become an integral and vital component. With this in mind, this research
  work is aimed at analyzing the Cloud workloads and further evaluating the
  performances of two widely used prediction techniques such as Markov modelling
  and Bayesian modelling with 7 hours of Google cluster data. An important
  outcome of this research work is the categorization and characterization of
  the Cloud workloads which will assist in leading into the user demand
  prediction parameter modelling.
