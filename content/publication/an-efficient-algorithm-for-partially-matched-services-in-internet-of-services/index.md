abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices in an
  Internet-like structure. Each device is encapsulated as a real-world service
  that provides functionality and exchanges information with other devices. This
  large-scale information exchange results in new interactions between things
  and people. Unlike traditional web services, the internet of services is
  highly dynamic and continuously changing due to constant degradation, vanish
  and possibly reappearance of the devices, this opens a new challenge in the
  process of resource discovery and selection. In response to the increasing
  numbers of services in the discovery and selection process, there is a
  corresponding increase in the number of service consumers and the consequent
  diversity of quality of service (QoS) available. An increase in both sidesâ€™
  leads to diversity in the demand and supply of services, which would result in
  the partial match of the requirements and offers. This paper proposed an IoT
  service ranking and selection algorithm by considering multiple QoS
  requirements and allowing partially matched services to be counted as a
  candidate for the selection process. One of the applications of IoT sensory
  data that attracts many researchers is transportation especially emergency and
  accident services which is used as a case study in this paper. Experimental
  results from real-world services showed that the proposed method achieved
  significant improvement in the accuracy and performance in the selection
  process.
