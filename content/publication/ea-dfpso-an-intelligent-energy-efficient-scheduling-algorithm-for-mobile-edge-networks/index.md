abstract: Cloud datacenters have become overwhelmed with data-intensive
  applications due to the limited computational capabilities of mobile
  terminals. Mobile edge computing is emerging as a potential paradigm to host
  application execution at the edge of networks to reduce transmission delays.
  Compute nodes are usually distributed in edge environments, enabling crucially
  efficient task scheduling among those nodes to achieve reduced processing
  time. Moreover, it is imperative to conserve edge server energy, enhancing
  their lifetimes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel task scheduling
  algorithm named Energy-aware Double-fitness Particle Swarm Optimization
  (EA-DFPSO) that is based on an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm
  for achieving energy efficiency in an edge computing environment along with
  minimal task execution time. The proposed EA-DFPSO algorithm applies a dual
  fitness function to search for an optimal tasks-scheduling scheme for saving
  edge server energy while maintaining service quality for tasks. Extensive
  experimentation demonstrates that our proposed EA-DFPSO algorithm outperforms
  the existing traditional scheduling algorithms, in terms of achieving reduced
  task completion time and conserving energy in an edge computing environment.
