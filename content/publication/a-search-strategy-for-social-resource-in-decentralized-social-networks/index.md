abstract: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture is an appealing alternative to
  centralized architecture, especially for large-scale distributed internet
  applications. Owing to the similarity between human social networks and P2P
  social networks, where peer nodes are considered as persons, connections
  between peer nodes are considered as relationship, human social theories are
  used to construct P2P social network aiming to improve the performance and
  efficiency of resource discovery. In this paper, we propose a novel
  multi-function resource search strategy (MFRS) which can resolve complex
  queries for social resource discovery in P2P social networks. Firstly, each
  node in the P2P social networks builds its own knowledge base to facilitate
  the future search. During the search process, nodes in the network
  spontaneously form interest groups and discover resources in collaboration
  with each other. Furthermore, during the search period, peer nodes utilize a
  neighbour recommending algorithm and an adaptive routing algorithm to search
  resources more efficiently. Finally, the proposed strategy has been evaluated
  in a dynamic network. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of
  MFRS against existing methods.
