abstract: Despite the tremendous success of online social networks (OSNs),
  centrally controlled OSNs have inherent issues related to lack of user privacy
  and single point of failure. These limitations have motivated the research
  community to shift the computing paradigm from a centralised architecture to
  decentralised alternatives. Existing research works mainly focused on the
  routing mechanisms using social information in decentralised OSNs, without
  considering the user's privacy. This paper proposes a self-organised
  decentralised architecture (SDA) that leverages privacy-preserved routing
  methods to facilitate query routing in decentralised social networks. This
  architecture encompasses a hash-based profiling model to characterise semantic
  features of the user's content with low dimensionality and privacy-aware
  mechanisms to organise similarity users into semantic communities.
  Furthermore, a probabilistic routing method is proposed to support efficient
  information dissemination and service discovery. The correctness and
  efficiency of our proposed approach are evaluated through simulations on
  real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that our approach
  achieved a better topological structure with high routing efficiency.
