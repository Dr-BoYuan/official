abstract: Internet of People (IoP), which focuses on personal information
  collection by a wide range of the mobile applications, is the next frontier
  for Internet of Things. Nowadays, people become more and more dependent on the
  Internet, increasingly receiving and sending information on social networks
  (e.g., Twitter, etc.); thus social networks play a decisive role in IoP.
  Therefore, community discovery has emerged as one of the most challenging
  problems in social networks analysis. To this end, many algorithms have been
  proposed to detect communities in static networks. However, microblogging
  social networks are extremely dynamic in both content distribution and
  topological structure. In this paper, we propose a model for efficient
  evolutionary user interest community discovery which employs a nature-inspired
  genetic algorithm to improve the quality of community discovery. Specifically,
  a preprocessing method based on hypertext induced topic search improves the
  quality of initial users and posts, and a label propagation method is used to
  restrict the conditions of the mutation process to further improve the
  efficiency and effectiveness of user interest community detection. Finally,
  the experiments on the real datasets validate the effectiveness of the
  proposed model.
