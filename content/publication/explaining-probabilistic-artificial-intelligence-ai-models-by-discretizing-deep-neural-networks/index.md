abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can learn from data and make
  decisions without any human intervention. However, the deployment of such
  models is challenging and risky because we do not know how internal
  decision-making is happening in these models. Especially, the high-risk
  decisions such as medical diagnosis or automated navigation demand
  explainability and verification of the decision-making process in AI
  algorithms. This research paper aims to explain Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  models by discretizing the black-box process model of deep neural networks
  using partial differential equations. The PDEs-based deterministic models
  would minimize the time and computational cost of the decision-making process
  and reduce the chances of uncertainty that make the prediction more
  trustworthy.
