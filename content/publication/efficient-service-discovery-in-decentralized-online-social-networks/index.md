abstract: Online social networks (OSN) have attracted millions of users
  worldwide over the last decade. There are a series of urgent issues faced by
  existing OSN such as information overload, single-point of failure and privacy
  concerns. The booming Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing provide
  paradigms for the development of decentralized OSN. In this paper, we build a
  self-organized decentralized OSN (SDOSN) on the overlay network of an IoT
  infrastructure resembling a real-life social graph. A user model based on
  homophily features is proposed considering social relationships and user
  interests and focuses on the key OSN functionality of efficient information
  dissemination. A swarm intelligence search method is also proposed to
  facilitate adaptive forwarding and effective service discovery. Our
  evaluation, performed in simulation using real-world datasets, shows that our
  approach achieves better performance when compared with the state-of-the-art
  methods in a dynamic network environment.
