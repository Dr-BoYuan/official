abstract: With the development of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) technologies, edge devices are witnessed to generate data at
  unprecedented volume. The Edge Intelligence (EI) has led to the emergence of
  edge devices in various application domains. The EI can provide efficient
  services to delay-sensitive applications, where the edge devices are deployed
  as edge nodes to host the majority of execution, which can effectively manage
  services and improve service discovery efficiency. The multilevel index model
  is a well-known model used for indexing service, such a model is being
  introduced and optimized in the edge environments to efficiently services
  discovery whilst managing large volumes of data. However, effectively updating
  the multilevel index model by adding new services timely and precisely in the
  dynamic Edge Computing environments is still a challenge. Addressing this
  issue, this paper proposes a designated key selection method to improve the
  efficiency of adding services in the multilevel index models. Our experimental
  results show that in the partial index and the full index of multilevel index
  model, our method reduces the service addition time by around 84% and 76%,
  respectively when compared with the original key selection method and by
  around 78% and 66%, respectively when compared with the random selection
  method. Our proposed method significantly improves the service addition
  efficiency in the multilevel index model, when compared with existing
  state-of-the-art key selection methods, without compromising the service
  retrieval stability to any notable level.
