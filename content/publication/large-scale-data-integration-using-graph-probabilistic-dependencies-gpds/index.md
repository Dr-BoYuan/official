abstract: The diversity and proliferation of Knowledge bases have made data
  integration one of the key challenges in the data science domain. The
  imperfect representations of entities, particularly in graphs, add additional
  challenges in data integration. Graph dependencies (GDs) were investigated in
  existing studies for the integration and maintenance of data quality on
  graphs. However, the majority of graphs contain plenty of duplicates with high
  diversity. Consequently, the existence of dependencies over these graphs
  becomes highly uncertain. In this paper, we proposed graph probabilistic
  dependencies (GPDs) to address the issue of uncertainty over these large-scale
  graphs with a novel class of dependencies for graphs. GPDs can provide a
  probabilistic explanation for dealing with uncertainty while discovering
  dependencies over graphs. Furthermore, a case study is provided to verify the
  correctness of the data integration process based on GPDs. Preliminary results
  demonstrated the effectiveness of GPDs in terms of reducing redundancies and
  inconsistencies over the benchmark datasets.
