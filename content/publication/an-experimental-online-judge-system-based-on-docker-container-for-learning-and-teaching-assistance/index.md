abstract: Programming Languages are core courses in computer science and
  computing-related disciplines, and there are increasing demands on improving
  the experiences, motivation and efficiency of programming language teaching
  and learning. In recent decades, online judge (OJ) systems have been popularly
  adopted in educational environments to support real-time learning feedback,
  and provide interactive programming practice. However, most existing OJ
  systems rely on significant resource for hardware virtualization, and suffer
  from long development cycles and extensive maintenances. This paper proposed a
  course-oriented OJ system based on the Docker Container techniques to
  significantly reduce the cost and maintenance of deployment of existing OJ
  system. The proposed approach is designed in the form of an experimental
  system, which is effective in stimulating the students to learn programming
  language and assist the instant assessment of coursework. Meanwhile, our
  proposed system can be integrated with major massive open online course (MOOC)
  systems for assessment. The efficiency and performance of our proposed system
  has been evaluated and tested by 1460 students in Nanyang Institute of
  Technology during term time between 2018 and 2019.
