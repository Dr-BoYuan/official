abstract: With the advancement in communication technologies and the widespread
  availability of mobile devices, opportunistic mobile social networks (OMSNs)
  are gaining momentum in supporting spontaneous communication and interaction
  among end-users who opportunistically contact each other. However, existing
  research on message routing in OMSNs face major challenges on achieving a high
  routing efficiency and low latency for social information request. This paper
  proposes a personalised message routing (PMR) framework that leverages an
  inductive network embedding model and an attention-based mechanism to
  facilitate efficient message routing in opportunistic networks. Specifically,
  the network embedding model encompasses a higher-order proximity profiling
  algorithm in order to embed both the content-based and structure-based network
  features beyond immediate friends into low-dimensional representations.
  Further, we present an attentional neural network model to learn user-friend
  preferences, for the purpose of capturing the diversified interests among
  connected users and to determine the most informative friends during the
  message dissemination process. The performance of our proposed framework is
  evaluated through simulations on three real-world mobile network trace
  datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed PMR framework
  considerably and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art message routing
  methods.
