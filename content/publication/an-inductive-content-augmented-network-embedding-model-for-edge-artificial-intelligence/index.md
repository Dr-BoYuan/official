abstract: Real-time data processing applications demand dynamic resource
  provisioning and efficient service discovery, which is particularly
  challenging in resource-constraint edge computing environments. Network
  embedding techniques can potentially aid effective resource discovery services
  in edge environments, by achieving a proximity-preserving representation of
  the network resources. Most of the existing techniques of network embedding
  fail to capture accurate proximity information among the network nodes and
  further lack exploiting information beyond the second-order neighbourhood.
  This paper leverages artificial intelligence for network representation and
  proposes a deep learning model, named inductive content augmented network
  embedding (ICANE), which integrates the network structure and resource content
  attributes into a feature vector. Secondly, a hierarchical aggregation
  approach is introduced to explicitly learn the network representation through
  sampling the nodes and aggregating features from the higher-order
  neighbourhood. A semantic proximity search model is then designed to generate
  the top-k ranking of relevant nodes using the learned network representation.
  Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of
  the proposed model over the existing popular methods in terms of resource
  discovery and the query resolving performance.
