abstract: With the access of massive mobile devices, spectrum resources are
  becoming increasingly scarce. How to effectively and securely utilize the
  limited spectrum resources has become a fundamental challenge for future
  mobile communication systems. Focusing on intelligent sensing and sharing,
  this paper proposes a blockchain-based two-stage secure spectrum intelligent
  sensing and sharing auction mechanism (BISA), which selects appropriate base
  stations (BSs) to form a consortium blockchain to guarantee secure and
  efficient spectrum auction with low complexity. In the first stage, a
  reverse-auction-based incentive mechanism (RAIM) is presented to provide
  bidding strategies for the primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs)
  selecting the PU that maximizes the utility. In the second stage, a
  unit-utility-based auction algorithm (UUA) is proposed to achieve a stable
  match between PUs and SUs. PUs will select the SU with the maximum unit
  utility to complete the auction. Then, the transaction records are formed into
  blocks and uploaded to guarantee the security of transactions. Simulation
  results show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed BISA
  increases the total utility and throughput of SUs by 216.4% and 189.3%,
  respectively.
