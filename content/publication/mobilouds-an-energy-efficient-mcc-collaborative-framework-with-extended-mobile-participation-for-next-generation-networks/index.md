abstract: Given the emergence of mobile cloud computing (MCC), its associated
  energy implications are witnessed at larger scale. With offloading
  computationally intensive tasks to the cloud datacentres being the basic
  concept behind MCC, most of the mobile terminal resources participating in the
  MCC collaborative execution are wasted as they remain idle until the mobile
  terminals receive responses from the datacentres. This is an additional
  wastage of resources alongside the cloud resources are already being addressed
  as massive energy consumers. Though the energy consumed of the idle mobile
  resources is insignificant in comparison with the cloud counterpart, such
  consumptions have drastic impacts on the mobile devices causing unnecessary
  battery drains. To this end, this paper proposes Mobilouds which encompass a
  multi-tier processing architecture with various levels of process cluster
  capacities and a software application to manage energy efficient utilization
  of such process clusters. Our proposed Mobilouds framework encourages the
  mobile device participation in the MCC collaborative execution, thereby
  reduces the presence of idle mobile resources and utilizes such idle resources
  in the actual task execution. Our performance evaluation results demonstrate
  that the Mobilouds framework offers the most energy-time balancing process
  clusters for task execution by effectively utilizing the available resources,
  in comparison with an entire cloud offloading strategy using 5G/4G networks.
