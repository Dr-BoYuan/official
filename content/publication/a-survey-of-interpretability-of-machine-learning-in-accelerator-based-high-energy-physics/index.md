abstract: Data-intensive studies in the domain of accelerator-based High Energy
  Physics, HEP, have become increasingly more achievable due to the emergence of
  machine learning with high-performance computing and big data technologies. In
  recent years, the intricate nature of physics tasks and data has prompted the
  use of more complex learning methods. To accurately identify physics of
  interest, and draw conclusions against proposed theories, it is crucial that
  these machine learning predictions are explainable. For it is not enough to
  accept an answer based on accuracy alone, but it is important in the process
  of physics discovery to understand exactly why the output was generated. That
  is, completeness of a solution is required. In this paper, we survey the
  application of machine learning methods to a variety of accelerator-based
  tasks in a bid to understand what role interpretability plays within this
  area. The main contribution of this paper is to promote the need for
  explainable artificial intelligence, XAI, for the future of machine learning
  in HEP.
