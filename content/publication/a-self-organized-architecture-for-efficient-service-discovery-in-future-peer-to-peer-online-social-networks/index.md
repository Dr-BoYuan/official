abstract: With the unprecedented growing information services in online social
  networks (OSNs), Internet users are increasingly struggling to keep pace with
  the sheer volume of massively unstructured social data being created online
  through information services on a daily basis. However, most of OSNs are based
  on a centralized client-server architecture which can easily suffer from
  problems such as performance bottleneck and vulnerability to the single point
  of failure in large-scale networks. Moreover, all the data and services are
  stored in the service providers' data center, users could lose control of
  their privacy and ownership of their own data. This visionary paper is to
  propose a novel self-organized architecture and supporting mechanisms for
  efficient service discovery in next-generation peer-to-peer (P2P) online
  social networks which enables dynamic interaction, collaboration, social
  information sharing and discovering and improves the scalability, availability
  and efficiency of current centralized OSNs. In the architecture, users have
  more control over their own private information and have better access to the
  social network services online and offline.
