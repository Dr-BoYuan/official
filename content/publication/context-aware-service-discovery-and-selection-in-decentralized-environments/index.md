abstract: With the increasing use of web services in everyday tasks, we are
  entering an era of the Internet of Services (IoS). Service discovery and
  selection has become a critical issue in the area of web services. Traditional
  service discovery approaches are often supported by centralized registries
  that could suffer from single-point failure, performance bottleneck, and
  scalability issues in large-scale systems. To address these issues, in this
  paper we propose a context-aware service discovery and selection approach in a
  decentralized peer-to-peer environment. In the approach homophily similarity
  was used for bootstrapping and distribution of nodes. The discovery process is
  based on the similarity of nodes, previous interaction and behaviour of the
  nodes, which will help the discovery process in a dynamic environment. Our
  approach is not only considering service discovery, but also the selection of
  the best available web service by taking into account the QoS properties of
  the web services. Experimental results were based on a real-world semantic web
  service dataset, the results showed that the approach achieved better
  performance and efficiency in both discovery and selection processes.
