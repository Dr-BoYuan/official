abstract: With the rapid increase of growth and development in cloud computing
  it is clear to see that it is becoming a common trend within the industry
  leading to the adoption by businesses and Information Technology (IT) users
  alike. Coupled with this trend comes a vast amount of academic research into
  the cloud computing industry covering most aspects but still leaving some
  untouched. There is, however, a gap in the academic research for this specific
  area with current studies focusing on very specific performance issues without
  considering a general overview of performance. This paper demonstrates the
  importance of understanding the need to benchmark cloud platforms in order to
  gain a performance overview of the platforms which one may be integrating into
  a production environment. This paper investigates the performance of two
  open-source cloud platforms, Open Stack and Cloud Stack. The performance
  testing is strictly focused on the platforms themselves other than the
  underlying elements. Therefore, the platforms have both been tested on a
  mutual hyper visor and mutual available resources. The experiment results
  demonstrate the advantages of performing cloud management platform
  benchmarking.
