Project description:  Development of a data science pipeline system which takes a live data stream from a source data system and parses it so that it can be visualised instantly in a virtual environment.

This project aims to create new technologies and tools for Bloc Digital to reduce the time and cost of virtual object creation and evaluation in the development lifecycle.
