Project description:  Development of a data science pipeline system which takes a live data stream from a source data system and parses it so that it can be visualised instantly in a virtual environment.

This project aims to create new technologies and tools for Bloc Digital to reduce the time and cost of virtual object creation and evaluation in the development lifecycle.

Key challenges of this project:

* Large volumes of data that are complex to streamline and are manually processed
  Visualisation of complex data by producing 3D models of the data in real-time. Capturing changes that happen in the source systems and visualising these changes in 3D VR platforms
* Collaboration in VR - Receiving data streams from distributed databases and interpreting, harmonising, and streaming this data to the VR platform
* Collaborative design - Designing the platform keeping in view the requirements of the customer-owned data source systems and the engineering teams making use of this data for interactive 3D VR visualisations
